# WhereTo

## A place for vacationers to plan trips and get suggestions

I recently traveled with my family to a foreign country, and while the trip was amazing, the planning was less so. Trying keep track of hotels, events, places, and times was pretty annoying, so I thought it would be cool to build a tool that travelers could use to easily see all their plans in one place.

The current version allows a user to:
* Enter a basic trip overview
* Add hotels and dates
* View a daily itinerary for each day of the trip
* Add plans and times to that itinerary
* View a basic map from Google Maps

In progress:
* View suggested events and restaurants based on Google Places and Yelp APIs
* Add markers to the map for relevant locations
